Pseudo Design of code:

we  have a LIST_position = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and

 LIST_choice = [O, X]

Dictionary of [A: (0,1,2);

                        B: (3, 4, 5) 

                        C: (6, 7, 8) 

                        D: (0,3,6) 

                        E:  (1, 4, 7) 

                        F:  (2, 5, 8) 

                       G: (2, 4, 6) 

                       H: (0, 4, 8) ]

(Player)HumanTurn Function() {

choice = input (Enter choice (X or O))

position  = input (choose position (0 to 8))

while choice is neither X or 0: keep asking for choice input

while position is less than 0 ore greater than 8, keeping asking for asking for position input

for example if Xis chosen then Playerchoice = LIST_choice.remove(X) playerposition, letâ€™s say 8 = LIST_position.remove(8)

}

ComputerTurn Function() {

Computerchoice = List_choice.pop() 

computer position() random from 0 to 7

if Player(Human) chooses X, Computer chooses O

if Player(Human) chooses O, Computer chooses X

}

Main gameFunction() {

the game should run while this list is not empty

while LIST.length > 0:

Human Turn 

Computer Turn

}
